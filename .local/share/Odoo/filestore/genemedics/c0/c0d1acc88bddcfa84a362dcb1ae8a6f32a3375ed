WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER® SERVICES ("SERVICES") ARE PROVIDED TO YOU SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL TERMS AND CONDITIONS <http://www.westernunion.com/us/terms-conditions> ) AND APPLICABLE LAW. Service depends on factors including Service selected, selected delivery options, amount sent, destination country, currency availability, regulatory and consumer protection issues, identification requirements, delivery restrictions, agent location hours, differences in time zones, and additional terms set forth in the full terms and conditions <http://www.westernunion.com/us/terms-conditions>  (collectively, "Restrictions"). The designated recipient ("Receiver") may generally receive funds sent by Western Union consumer ("You") at Agent locations in the Expected Payout Location. For transactions received within the U.S., Expected Payout Location generally means any Agent location in the destination state or U.S. territory. For transactions received outside the U.S., Expected Payout Location generally means any Agent location in the destination country. Services offered by Telecomunicaciones de Mexico ("Telecomm") are only available at Telecomm locations. You may pay for the Services using a U.S. issued Visa or MasterCard credit card, or debit card issued by a financial institution located in the U.S. ("Bank Card"). Alternatively, you may pay with cash at a Western Union Agent location or using Western Union's WU® Pay, ACH or Account based options ("Alternative Payment Options"). The total due is payable before Western Union processes the transaction. If Western Union does not receive authorization from the bank or other provider of an Account (the "Account Provider"), the transaction will not be processed and funds will not be transmitted to the Receiver. Western Union shall charge Your designated Bank Card or applicable Account for the Total disclosed to You relating to the transaction. Account Provider may impose additional fees on an Account. The agreement with the Account Provider governs use of an Account and provides the rights and liabilities of the holder of an Account. Receiver will normally receive funds sent by You in cash, check, or a combination thereof; with some Services, funds may be credited to a bank, prepaid or credit card, mobile wallet, or similar Account. You authorize Western Union to honor Receiver's election of payout method that differs from the payout method You specify. Receipt of funds through a payout method other than cash or in a currency other than the one You selected may incur additional fees. Transactions may be reported to applicable authorities. Messaging and notification services may incur additional fees. Western Union relies on the information you provide us to send money. Please review all transaction details for accuracy.

For transfers that begin and end in the United States, Qualifying refunds will be made within 45 days of receipt of Your valid written request. Western Union may issue refunds through a Western Union money transfer or to the Bank Card or Alternative Payment Option used to pay for the transaction.
